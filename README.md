Some widget flags still need to be written in the fancy Odin code, since it's a lot I will write based on my needs.

This binding is built with immutable Nuklear flags in mind, so if you need to add or remove, its required to check if the binding dont broke.

* NK_INCLUDE_COMMAND_USERDATA
* NK_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR
* NK_KEYSTATE_BASED_INPUT
* NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_BOOL
* NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPES
